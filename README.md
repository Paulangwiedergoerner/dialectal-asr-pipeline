# Dialectal ASR Enhancement Pipeline

This repository contains the complete implementation of our research paper:

[Enhancing Dialectal ASR Research Paper (PDF)](https://github.com/Paulangwiedergoerner/dialectal-asr-pipeline/blob/main/Enhancing%20Dialectal%20ASR%20Research%20paper.pdf)


The system builds upon OpenAIâ€™s Whisper model to improve recognition accuracy on dialectal English (Irish and Scottish) and accented German by applying three post-decoding modules: semantic reranking, phoneme-aware correction, and speaker origin classification.

---

## Project Overview

Modern ASR systems underperform on dialectal and accented speech due to poor representation of regional phonology and prosody in training data. This project presents a modular pipeline that improves Whisper's transcription output post-decoding without modifying the core model.

## Pipeline Modules

### GB English Pipeline (`[speech_pro_english.py](`https://github.com/Paulangwiedergoerner/dialectal-asr-pipeline/blob/main/speech_pro_english.py`)
- Whisper-small fine-tuning on Irish & Scottish speech
- Semantic reranking using BERT
- Phoneme-aware correction using CMUdict
- Dialect classification (DistilBERT on text)

### DE German Pipeline (`[speech_pro_german.py](https://github.com/Paulangwiedergoerner/dialectal-asr-pipeline/blob/main/speech_pro_german.py)`)
- Whisper-small fine-tuning on native & foreign-accented German
- Semantic reranking using SBERT
- Phoneme-aware correction using Phonemizer (IPA)
- Speaker origin classification using logistic regression on MFCCs, ZCR, and spectral contrast

## Results

### English
- **WER (after correction):** 0.77%
- **Dialect classification accuracy:** 79.76%

### German
| Pipeline Stage           | WER (%)   |
|--------------------------|-----------|
| Whisper Baseline         | 5.67      |
| + Semantic Reranking     | 1.89      |
| + Phoneme Correction     | 1.89      |

- **Accent classification accuracy:** 79.76%
